Decisions are a fundamental part of programming and algorithms. 

## Real World
Let's start off with some real world examples.

- **If** the water is boiling, **then** put an egg in.
- **If** it is raining, **then** put up your umbrella.
- **If** the sun is shining, **then** put on your sunglasses otherwise take them off.

In all three examples, you can see that there is an **if** and a **then**.

What we are doing is to make a decision based on a condition.

Let's take the first example and extend it a bit ...

- **If** the water is boiling
- **then** put an egg in the water
- **otherwise** wait a bit longer

## The condition
The condition is **is the water boiling**? Do you see how the answer to this can be either **true** or **false**? The water is either boiling (true) or not boiling (false). 

## The action
Depending on whether the condition evaluates to true or false, we can now take one of two actions ..

- **true** put an egg in the water
- **false** wait a bit longer

Let's see how we put this to use in Flode.
