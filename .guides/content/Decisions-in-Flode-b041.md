Take a look at the Flode chart on the left. Here, we are taking an input and **if** it is greater than 100 **then** we are outputting 'Big' **otherwise**  we are outputting 'Small'.

## Condition
In this example, the condition is `input0 > 100`. You can see how this condition can be either true or false. These are the only possible outcomes of a decision.

You can see in the Flode chart how the chart executes according to the input value. Change the test input value to 50 and step through it. You will see exactly how Flode executes. Now change it to 200 and step through again.

## Coding
When we come to real coding, you will see that these conditions crop up all over the place.
