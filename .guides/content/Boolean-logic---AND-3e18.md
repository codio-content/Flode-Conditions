Now we come onto something that allows us to do more powerful stuff with our conditions.


Consider the following example.

> If the number is greater than or equal to 10 **and** less than 100

This is written in Flode as 

```javascript
if number>=100 and number<100
```

To make it more readable, feel free to add spaces like this

```javascript
if number >= 10 and number < 100
```
