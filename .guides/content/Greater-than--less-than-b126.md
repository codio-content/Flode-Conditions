There are a variety of *logical operators* you can use in conditions. Here are the ones you will use most often. 

Remember these or come back and look at them as you do the challenges that come later.

| Test | Example |
|-|-|
| Equals | `number = 1` |
| Not equals | `number != 1` |
| Less than | `number < 100` |
| Less than or equal | `number <= 100` |
| Greater than | `number > 100` |
| Greater than or equal | `number >= 100` |

The challenges on the next page make a lot of use of these *logical operators*, so get ready!
