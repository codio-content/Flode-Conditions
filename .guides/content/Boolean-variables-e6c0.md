A boolean variable can only have 2 values : `true` and `false`. 

These are not string values `'true'` and `'false'` but are more like 0 and 1. 

The reason these are so important is that they are used all over the place in decision making.

Consider an expression we are already familiar with 

```javascript
x > 100
```

This actually evaluates to a boolean result of `true` or `false`. 

Look at the Flode chart on the left. You can see this in action. The program execution will go one way or the other after then expression `x > 100` is evaluated.

- If it is `true` (x is greater than 100) then it outputs 'Big'.
- If it is `false` (x is less than or equal to 100) then it outputs 'Small'.
