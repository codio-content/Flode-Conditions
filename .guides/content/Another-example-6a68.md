The example Flode chart you see on the left takes the previous example a bit further. We are now solving the following problem.

> If the number is less than or equal to 100, output 'Small'. If the number is larger than 100 then if it is also larger than 200, output 'Huge' otherwise output 'Big'.

Play around with the input value and step through the chart so you can see how it works.
