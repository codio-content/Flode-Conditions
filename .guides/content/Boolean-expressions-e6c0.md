Let's consider an expression we are already familiar with 

```javascript
input0 > 100
```

This expression actually evaluates to a boolean result of `true` or `false`. 

Look at the Flode chart on the left. You can see this in action. The program execution will go one way or the other after the expression `input0 > 100` is evaluated.

- If it is `true` (input0 is greater than 100) then it outputs 'Big'.
- If it is `false` (input0 is less than or equal to 100) then it outputs 'Small'.
