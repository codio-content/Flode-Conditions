Boolean (named after a chap named George Boole) is something that can have two states : `true` or `false`

Boolean states really important as they are used all over the place in decision making.

Don't worry, though, it's not tought to pick up.

Let's consider an expression we are already familiar with 

```javascript
x > 100
```

This actually evaluates to a boolean result of `true` or `false`. 

Look at the Flode chart on the left. You can see this in action. The program execution will go one way or the other after then expression `x > 100` is evaluated.

- If it is `true` (x is greater than 100) then it outputs 'Big'.
- If it is `false` (x is less than or equal to 100) then it outputs 'Small'.
