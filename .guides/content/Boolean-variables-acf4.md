Boolean variables are the third variable type we are introducing you to after numbers and strings.

A boolean variable can only have 2 values : `true` and `false`. 

These are not string values `'true'` and `'false'` but are more like 0 and 1. 

So in a Flode block, you could put either of the following

```javascript
isCold = true
isCold = false
```

Now look at the Flode chart on the left. Here you can see that we are making a decision based on this variable.

Notice how the decision condition is just `isCold`? We could also write it like this and it would behave exactly the same.

```javascript
isCold = true
```

## Not
Now look at the second decision. The expression `!hasJumper` can be read as '**not** has a jumper. 

Note the `!` character before `hasJumper`. This character reads 'not'.

We could also have written it like this

```javascript
hasJumper = false
```

## Play with the chart
Go ahead and step through the chart. Feel free to change the values of `isCold` and `hasJumper` and follow the flow of execution.

We will move on to a couple of challenges to reinforce the Boolean concepts.
