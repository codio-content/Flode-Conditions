Now we come onto something that allows us to do more powerful stuff with our conditions.


Consider the following example.

> If the number is greater than 100 *and less than 200

This is written in Flode as 

```javascript
if number>100 and number<200
```

To make it more readable, feel free to add spaces like this

```javascript
if number > 100 and number < 200
```

## Preparing for coding
In Javascript, which we'll  be playing with later on, 'and' is actually written as `&&`, so

```javascript
if number > 100 && number < 200
```
